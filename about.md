	<h1 class="pageTitle">About LP Devs</h1>
  Hi, I am Pham Van Lam (<a href='https://lpdevs.herokuapp.com/'>LP Devs</a>). I come from Viet Nam. I am a <b>developer</b> and a <b>blogger</b>. I create this website to share all my projects to you all.
  <br><br>

  When I was learning at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology, my field is Electronic and Telecomunication. But I am passionate about programming. So now, I am working as a software programmer. 
  I am advanced at C/C++, Java/Android and intermediate at Javascript, Nodejs, ExpressJs. This website is created while I was learning about Nodejs, Expressjs and MongoDB.
  <br><br>

  Here are some of all my projects about:

  <h4>Android applications</h4>
